Kingdom Code a community of people who love Jesus and love tech. We're creatives, developers, designers, entrepreneurs and innovators. So, whether you work in tech or simply have a passion for it, there's a place for you to come, learn, grow, make friends, network and have fun.

Over the next few months we're launching a set of events in Leeds to build relationships, explore how our faith and tech intersect and show off our latest projects. Kingdom Code is a place to start thinking about how our Christian worldview meets our vocation.
